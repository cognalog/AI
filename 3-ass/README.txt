I have two  evaluation functions: one for casual situations and another for emergencies.  Emergency board situations are characterized by various combinations of dangers: few available moves, proximity to the opponent, proximity to astrices and others. In case of emergency, the isolation bot will skip the minimax recursion altogether and greedily use the careful evaluation function (which prioritizes the more conservative of the heuristics described below).

For heuristic purposes my isolation bot measures several board properties of interest. The most obvious thing worth keeping track of is the amount of moves available to the bot, and I decided to factor in the amount of moves available to the opponent as well in order to encourage the bot's aggression in addition to its carefulness.  Another heuristic, purely offensive, measures the amount of clumpiness among the asterices on the board.  I do not give this heuristic very much weight because having a labrinthe-y board can backfire in a heartbeat. My final, coolest heuristic finds the area of the largest rectangle of free space around my bot.  This, I feel, is a more powerful version of the available move checking--especially when there is a growing partition on the board and the bot needs to be on the spacier side.  Unfortunately, the rectangular nature of the sought-after free space prevents the heuristic from recognizing winding paths full of legitimate moves (a late-game occurrence).  Moving forward, I would fix this shortcoming and do a better job of encouraging partition formation.
